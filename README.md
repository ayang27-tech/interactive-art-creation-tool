# interactive-art-creation-tool
The final product will be an Interactive Art Creation Tool that allows users to generate abstract digital art pieces through an intuitive interface. Users will interact with various parameters to create their own unique artworks by adjusting colors, shapes, and patterns. The application will feature:

A canvas where the art is drawn.
UI elements (sliders, buttons) for controlling various aspects of the artwork (e.g., color, shape type, size).
The ability to save the generated art as an image file.
This project aims to combine artistic creativity with programming skills, providing both an engaging experience for users and a technical challenge for the developer.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I aim to achieve the following objectives:

Demonstrate Abstraction: Create a class that encapsulates the properties and methods related to the generated art, such as ArtPiece. This class will manage the state of the art (e.g., shapes, colors) and methods to render it on the canvas.

Employ Useful Functions: Design and implement functions that handle tasks such as drawing shapes, generating color palettes, and saving the final artwork. These functions will utilize parameters effectively to customize output.

Thoughtful Design: Break down the project into various components:

Class: ArtPiece
Properties: shapes, colors, backgroundColor
Methods: draw(), addShape(), clearArt(), saveArt()
Functions: generateRandomColors(), setupCanvas(), createUserInterface()
Iterative Development: Use GitHub for version control, committing my progress, and documenting changes with clear messages describing the adjustments made at each stage of development.

Troubleshooting: Document issues faced during implementation and the strategies employed to resolve them. This could range from debugging code to optimizing performance.

Implementation Plan
Class Design:

Implement the ArtPiece class to encapsulate properties and methods related to the artwork.
